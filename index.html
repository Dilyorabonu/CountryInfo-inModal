          <p>
            Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked
            country located in west-central Europe. It is bordered by Italy to
            the south, France to the west, Germany to the north and Austria and
            Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is geographically divided
            among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the
            greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's
            population of 9 million are concentrated on the plateau, which hosts
            its largest cities and economic centres, including ZÃ¼rich, Geneva,
            and Basel.
